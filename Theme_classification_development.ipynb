He\\u2019s above!  But we can\\u2019t find Lee!  Where?!  The sand isn\\u2019t keeping up at all!  So it\\u2019s the Sand Armor again\\u2026?  Then how\\u2019s this?!  What\\u2026?!  This Sand Armor is\\u2026  being peeled away\\u2026!  You\\u2019re a stubborn one.  Since it comes to this\\u2026  The muscles have torn\\u2026  Is that really Lee\\u2026?  When did he become like this\\u2026?  This is the end!  The Fifth Gate of Closing\\u2026open!  I can\\u2019t defend myself\\u2026  Is this the movement of\\\\Na human being?!  Neji\\u2026  This technique is my ace in\\\\Nthe hole to take you down\\u2026  but I will specially show it to you!  Huh?!  The Sand Shield can\\u2019t keep up!  Most of the armor has also\\\\N been peeled off\\u2026  He\\u2019s done for!  W-Wow!  Hidden Lotus\\u2026 In other words...  it\\u2019s a high-speed continuous\\\\NTaijutsu that can\\u2019t even be touched!  The answer to take Neji down is\\\\Nthat high speed combination\\u2026  There is no way that\\\\Nthe sand can keep up!  This technique will be the last!  Hidden Lotus!  I can\\u2019t see anything, it\\u2019s too fast\\u2026  That\\u2019s impossible\\u2026  The gourd has turned to sand\\u2026?  He\\u2019s done it this time!  Gaara!  Lee\\u2026  Oh!  What\\u2019s\\u2026that?  He protects himself\\u2026  using a gourd made of sand?!  That technique is\\u2026!  Sand Coffin!  No way!  He got hit by the Hidden Lotus  and is still able to bring\\\\Nforth a technique\\u2026!  Sand Coffin!  I just can not lose in a place like this\\u2026  I want to\\u2026  my Way of the Ninja\\u2026  Oh no!  Die!  Why\\u2026?  Why\\u2026save him?  He\\u2019s\\u2026  I\\u2019m all right!  I\\u2019m strong so\\u2026  The Chunin Exam\\u2026  Guy Sensei, please watch\\\\Nme with a smile...  I\\u2019d like to prove that I could\\\\Nbecome a respectable Ninja  even though I can\\u2019t use Ninjutsu!  That would be the ultimate for me!  He is...  an important subordinate\\\\Nwhom I care for!  A subordinate\\u2026whom I care for...?  Those words are definitely\\\\Nnot understandable to Gaara\\u2026  I quit\\u2026  He quit\\u2026?  The moment Guy jumped in,\\\\NLee lost.  The winner\\u2026  Gaa-!  \\u2013 Wha\\u2026? \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\u2013 Huh?  \\u2013 Huh? \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\u2013 Huh?  Wha--?!  That\\u2019s impossible\\u2026  Having opened the fifth gate\\u2026  And his hand and feet are crushed\\u2026  There\\u2019s no way he should\\\\Nbe able to stand\\u2026!  Lee\\u2026  It\\u2019s all right.  It\\u2019s over!  You\\u2019re in no condition to stand\\u2026!  Lee\\u2026  Y-You\\u2026  You are\\u2026  Even after having\\\\Nlost consciousness\\u2026  You still want to prove your\\\\Nown Way of the Ninja\\u2026?  So he had already\\u2026  lost consciousness\\u2026  Lee...  You\\u2019re already\\u2026  a respectable Ninja\\u2026!  The winner\\u2026  Gaara.  Lee!  Stop!  Even if you went down\\\\Nwhat could you do?  Your words of encouragement\\\\Nwould only make him feel worse.  There\\u2019s no way he could\\\\Nhave beaten Gaara\\u2026  He was faced with a tougher battle\\\\Nthan we thought\\u2026  That Naruto\\u2026  Bushy Brow lost\\\\Nto a guy like this\\u2026!  Medics, please hurry.  Bushy Brow\\u2026  Lee\\u2026  You are the Jonin in charge of him,\\\\Naren\\u2019t you?  Y-Yes.  Please come with me\\\\Nfor a minute.  Careful\\u2026  Don\\u2019t shake him.  There is faint breathing\\u2026  but because of comminuted fractures\\\\Nand muscle tears to his entire body,  recovery will likely to take\\\\Nquite some time\\u2026  If that was all, it wouldn\\u2019t be so bad, but\\u2026  The damage to the left arm\\\\Nand leg which received the attack is severe\\u2026  It\\u2019s too severe\\u2026  Oh\\u2026!  I don\\u2019t want to say this,  but he won't be able to...\\\\Nlive as a Shinobi again.  T-That\\u2026  that can\\u2019t be true\\u2026  I will take Bushy Brow down.\\\\NBelieve it!  It is not you whom I want to fight,\\\\Nit\\u2019s Uchiha!  You\\u2026!  Naruto, I get where you're\\\\Ncoming from, believe me.  But all fighting must be done\\\\Nofficially in a match!  The failure beats the gifted genius\\\\Nthrough sheer effort\\u2026  Wouldn't that make for\\\\Nan exciting main battle?  Though, I am probably going\\\\N to be the one fighting Neji\\u2026  Lee\\u2026  I didn\\u2019t want to think... that you\\u2019d lose.  I wanted to let you fulfill\\u2026  your Way of the Ninja!  Yay!  I finally mastered it!  Yahoo!  This technique\\u2026  after all, only Lee managed to master\\u2026  Okay, you became Genin\\\\N from today.  I want to hear what it is\\\\Nyou all are aiming for!  I-I\\u2019d like to prove that I can become\\\\Na respectable Ninja  even though I can\\u2019t use\\\\NNinjutsu or Genjutsu!  That would be the ultimate for me!  Please forgive me for not\\u2026  stopping it...!  Lee\\u2026  It\\u2019s not true\\u2026it\\u2019s not true.  After hearing that,\\\\Nwhat should Bushy Brow do\\u2026?!  This guy\\u2026  He said the failure would take\\\\Ndown a genius with effort\\u2026!  Isn\\u2019t there something that\\\\Ncan be done?!  Calm down, Naruto.  B-But\\u2026Kakashi Sensei!  He kept saying he wanted\\\\Nto battle Sasuke and Neji!  Perhaps\\u2026that led to his ruin.  To fulfill that dream\\u2026  the boy even used a self-sacrificing\\\\Nforbidden technique to try to win!  The result is what you see\\u2026  That boy\\u2026  Sasuke and Neji\\u2026  and you\\u2026  he sacrificed himself to\\\\Na promise he never spoke of.  He risked his life\\u2026  so that he might have\\\\Na chance to battle you guys\\u2026  Don't forget that\\u2026  I wonder if Lee\\u2026  will be all right\\u2026?  Lee\\u2026  You didn\\u2019t realize it even at the end\\u2026  Heaven does not allow it.  One who tries to move ahead\\\\Nwhile achieving victory  through a method like dying\\\\Nupon each other\\u2019s swords.  So it ended without incident\\u2026  Welcome back Gaara.  Guy\\u2026  Well\\u2026  I spoke self-importantly earlier but\\u2026  I\\u2019ve thought about it and\\\\Nhad I been in your position\\u2026  I probably... wouldn\\u2019t have\\\\Nbeen able to stop him.  Guy.  We\\u2019re in the way of the\\\\Nnext tournament\\u2026let\\u2019s go up.  All right\\u2026  Then, the tenth and final round is next,\\\\Nboth contestants come forward!  So it\\u2019s finally my turn\\u2026  I\\u2019m gonna win and have\\\\Nsome barbecued beef!  In any case, I need to last until\\\\Nthe main tournament and battle Sasuke.  Or I will not have met your expectations,\\\\NLord Orochimaru\\u2026  I can almost see through it\\u2026  The reason that you went to the trouble\\\\Nof getting to Sasuke before us and...  putting a Curse Mark on him\\\\Nwithout killing him\\u2026  In other words,  we were the guinea pigs to measure\\\\NSasuke\\u2019s abilities during the examinations.  What you wanted isn\\u2019t Sasuke\\u2019s life,\\\\Nbut Sasuke himself\\u2026  I was also taken for a fool\\u2026  Now, let the tenth round begin.  Hey, can you hear it?  The clear, blue sky goes on and on  The ocean spans limitlessly  Please keep that smile on your face forever  Or else I\\u2019ll cry  You won't have to search around you  It\\u2019s all ok now.  Everyone is inside\\\\Nthis hand  when you want to cry,\\\\Nand you want to run away  When you forget what happiness is  Just sing.  Light is born, and darkness was born  The two are one  Harmonia, feel the telepathy  Hey, can you hear it?  Sakura!  Do you know where\\\\NKakashi Sensei is?  Naruto...  I\\u2019m gonna have him watch\\\\Nmy training until the main tournament.  Kakashi Sensei is probably with Sasuke.  What\\u2019s up with you, Sakura?\\\\NYou seem a little down.  No, nothing\\u2026  It\\u2019s just that I get this bad feeling\\u2026  Next episode: \\u201cA Shadow in Darkness:\\\\NDanger Approaches Sasuke\\u201d  I feel uneasy for some reason\\u2026 \",\n          \"C'mon!  Running like a fugitive,  Being chased by something  Inside my heart is pounding  My throat dry like it's withering  For no single one,  To none does belong,  This time is ours, right now...  Unraveling the pain,  Unraveling our hearts,  Unraveling shadows  Stifling our breath,  Reaching for beyond,  Tearing through the dark  In fighting and in love  To the distant light above,  Yes, we are on the way  I wanna rock...  Rockin' my heart  Such intensity...  If I take a breath or move my eyes\\\\NI will be marked and killed \\u2013  that's what I'm feeling..  If I'm stuck like this for an hour,\\\\NI'll go mad.  Facing a Jonin intent to kill\\u2026  This sensation is like having\\\\Nmy life held in limbo...  No way! I'd rather die\\\\Nto escape this feeling!  Sasuke...  Don't worry. I'll protect\\\\Nyou all with my life.  I absolutely won't allow\\\\Nmy comrades to get killed.  I don't know about that...  It's over.  Sensei! Behind you!!  Die!!  The Water Clone Jutsu...?  It can't be.  Don't move!  The Oath of Pain  It's over.  W-Wow!!  Did you say it's over?  You don't understand, do you?  You won't be able to beat me\\\\Njust by making like a monkey\\u2026  No chance.  But, I must say you're good.  My Water Clone Jutsu was\\\\Nbeing copied at that point\\u2026  I absolutely won't allow\\\\Nmy comrades to get killed.  By letting the clone talk as if it were you,\\\\Nyou succeeded in distracting me.  And you used Hidden Mist Jutsu\\\\Nto hide yourself to see what I was doing\\u2026  But\\u2026  I'm not a fool.  That one was a fake too!  Now!  Makibishi spikes\\u2026!  How foolish...!  Sensei!  Oh, I can't believe that\\\\NKakashi Sensei got \\u2026  kicked away like that\\u2026.  His Taijutsu skills are also\\\\Nextremely good.  W-What's with this water...?\\\\Nlt's awfully heavy.  Humph... Fool!  It's the Water Prison Jutsu!  Darn it.  My temporary escape\\\\Ninto the water\\u2026  was a huge mistake!  You're caught\\u2026  It's a special prison that makes\\\\Nit impossible for you to escape!  It makes things harder\\\\Nhaving you able to act.  Now\\u2026Kakashi.  I'll have to settle things\\\\Nwith you later.  First, I will finish those guys off.  Water Clone Jutsu\\u2026  Didn't expect this level of skill\\u2026  You're acting big,\\\\Nwearing a headband like a Ninja\\u2026  But\\u2026a real Ninja is one  who has hovered between\\\\Nlife and death numerous times.  In other words,  only those who are worth being listed\\\\Nin my Bingo Book  deserve to be called Ninja.  Guys like you can't be\\\\Ncalled real Ninja.  He's disappeared again!  You're just a kid!  Naruto!  You three! Take Tazuna and run!  You have no chance\\\\Nagainst this guy!  As long as he has me trapped\\\\Nin this Water Prison,  he won't be able\\\\Nto move from here.  And he shouldn't be able to use\\\\Nthe Water Clone Jutsu  if he's far enough away\\\\Nfrom his real body.  In any case, just run for now!  Run away?  You've got to be kidding me.  That option was gone\\\\Nfrom the moment you got caught.  Even if we ran,  without you, sooner or later\\\\Nwe'd be defeated by Zabuza\\u2026  and we'd all be destroyed.  Even if we were to reform\\\\Nthe Manji defense,  it would be impossible\\\\Nto block his attacks.  In the end\\u2026  we'll have...  no options left.  In order for us to survive,\\\\Nour only option is to rescue you.  We'll just have to do it!  There\\u2026!  Too easy.  Sasuke!  Sasuke\\u2026  T-This is the Jonin level\\u2026\\\\NA real Ninja\\u2026  We've got to run\\u2026\\\\NAt this rate\\u2026  Seriously\\u2026! Seriously\\u2026!  We'll be killed!!  I'm going to swear on\\\\Nthe pain of my left hand!  I'll never get into another situation\\\\Nfrom which I'll have to be rescued\\u2026  I'll never be afraid or\\\\Nbe a coward.  Are you hurt\\u2026scaredy cat?  I won't lose to Sasuke.  Can I borrow that\\\\NLeaf headband for a while?  This?  This is worn only by those who have\\\\Ngraduated from Ninja Academy.  Naruto, come over here.\\\\NI'd like to give you something.  Congratulations on your graduation.  That's because you're\\\\Nall squirts  who don't have the qualifications\\\\Nto become Ninjas.  Missions are all risky assignments.  You pass!  I'm not that little prankster\\\\Nthat you think I am!  I'm going to surpass the Hokage!  And so I'm going to get\\\\Nthe entire Village  to acknowledge my existence!  That's right\\u2026  I am a Ninja now. And...  I decided that I was not going\\\\Nto run anymore!  That I wouldn't run away\\u2026!  Y-You fool! Stop it!  Oh, Naruto! What are you thinking?!  Humph! Fool...  What are you thinking\\u2026\\\\Ncharging off on your own?!  Even Sasuke is no match for him\\u2026  No matter how hard we try,\\\\Nwe Genin are no match for him\\u2026  Huh...?!  The headband\\u2026.?!  Hey! You, with no brows...  Record in your Bingo Book\\u2026  about the man who will one day\\\\Nbecome the Leaf Village's Hokage.  Leaf-style Ninja\\u2026  Naruto Uzumaki!!  Naruto\\u2026  When I first saw that little kid,\\\\Nhe seemed so unreliable\\u2026  Sasuke! Lend me your ear!  What is it?  I have a plan.  You want to discuss plans\\\\Nunder these circumstances\\u2026?  This guy...!  Humph!\\\\NYou are talking of teamwork?  W-What is this feeling\\u2026?  Was Naruto so\\u2026?  Now...  Let's get wild\\u2026  Now, let's get wild!  Such loud snorting,\\\\Nbut do you have a winning plan?  T-This isn't good\\u2026  What are you guys doing!\\\\NI told you to run!  It was obvious what was going to happen\\\\Nonce I was caught!  Hurry! Run!  Listen to me!\\\\NOur mission is to protect Tazuna!  Have you forgotten that?!  Old man\\u2026.  Well...  This is a seed that I planted\\u2026  I can't say that\\\\NI want my life to be spared.  Sorry, you guys\\u2026  Fight as much as you want!  You hear that?  Are you ready?  You guys really haven't learned\\\\Nanything, have you?  W-What?!  You're still playing at being Ninja?  When I was your age,  this hand was already\\\\Nstained red with blood!  Zabuza, the Demon!  Ohh\\u2026? It seems that\\\\Nyou've heard of me.  A long time ago, in the Mist Village,\\\\Noften called the town of Blood Mist,  Ninja candidates faced\\\\Ntheir biggest hurdle.  So you also know about\\\\Nthat graduation exam\\u2026  That graduation exam?  What is it...?  This graduation exam\\\\Nthat you're talking about...  The students killed each other.  What\\u2026.?  Classmates who had shared rice\\\\Nfrom the same pot  formed pairs and tried\\\\Nto kill each other.  It didn't end\\\\Nuntil one of them died.  Partners who used to talk about\\\\Neach other's dreams and aspirations\\u2026  How cruel\\u2026  Ten years ago,  the Mist Village's graduation exam\\\\Nwas forced to undergo drastic reform.  That was because an evil demon\\\\Nhad appeared on the scene the previous year.  Reform?  What about the reform?  What had that evil demon done?  With no scruples or hesitation\\u2026  a young boy who didn't even have\\\\Nthe qualifications for being a Ninja,  annihilated over a hundred examinees.  That sure was\\u2026fun\\u2026  Sasuke!  Die!  Darn!  Shadow Clone Jutsu!  Ah... Shadow Clone Jutsu,\\\\Nand there are quite a few of them.  Here I go!  It's impossible, after all\\u2026  There is no way that\\\\Nyou can defeat the guy!  There is only one way left\\\\Nto defeat this guy!  Sasuke!  I see!  So that's your plan, Naruto!  That's pretty good for you!  Demon Wind Shuriken,  Windmill of Shadows\\u2026  A Shuriken won't work on me.  I see. This time\\\\Nit's aiming for my real body\\u2026  But...  It's not so easy!  A Shuriken in\\\\Nthe Shuriken's shadow...!  This is...\\\\NThe Shadow Shuriken Jutsu!  A second Shuriken\\\\Nin his blind spot!  But...  Still too na\\u00efve...  He dodged it!!  Here it is!  Yes! The plan worked!!  That Zabuza had no clue\\\\Nas to what I was thinking,  and I fooled him!  Ninja must be able\\\\Nto see through the obvious.  Did you see that \\u2013 the Leaf-style fighting\\\\Nof Naruto Uzumaki?!  Kakashi Sensei,\\\\Nthe rest is up to you.

It\\u2019s a Substitution?!  There!  Damn!  They\\u2019re getting closer and closer.  Damn!  This isn\\u2019t good, traces of blood!  Damn, I did save Akamaru\\\\Nfor the time being,  but maybe I went too far.  This smell\\u2026\\\\NWhat does it mean?  Why\\u2026 Why is it that even those guys\\\\Nare headed to a place like this?!

Pretty impressive\\u2026  You timed it well to scatter\\\\Nthe three to attack.  You must have practiced quite a bit, huh?  Since it\\u2019s a pretty complicated song\\u2026  Well now\\u2026  Not only did you\\\\Nimmediately understand  that I\\u2019m manipulating these guys\\\\Nwith my flute,  you understood how difficult this song is.\\\\NYou\\u2019re a pretty impressive punk.  But you can\\u2019t completely\\\\Nunderstand this song.  You're so right\\u2026\\\\Nsince art is so foreign to me.  But since she uses that flute\\\\Nto manipulate,  it means that song must contain\\\\Nindividually specific sound patterns  to control each and every movement\\\\Nof those guys.  I\\u2019m pretty confident\\\\Nwhen it comes to just analyzing,  but this time it\\u2019s not looking good.  The reason is that  I don\\u2019t understand\\\\Nmusical notes whatsoever.

Yeah…  I do understand it.  So…what of it?  This brat!  Don’t be acting cool…  It’s not just you who’s special!  Hinata was also…\\\\Nsuffering the same as you!  Even though she’s the head family,\\\\Nnot being acknowledged as such…  trying desperately to change herself…  She fought you while coughing\\\\Nup blood with that in mind!  You too!  The branch family that\\\\Nprotects the head family…  Doing all that to Hinata\\\\Njust because it’s an exam.  In actuality, you were just as frantic  in attempting to go\\\\Nagainst destiny, right?  Vitality has returned to Hinata’s face!  Just what I’d expect of\\\\Nthe Anbu Black Ops…  She\\'ll be okay.  Now she needs bed rest.  Your 64 Chakra Points are now shut…  How are you, who can’t use Chakra\\\\Nfor awhile, planning to fight?  At the end of the day,  you and Miss Hinata have\\\\Nthe same destiny!  Shut up!  With your Byakugan, labeling people\\\\Nand talking like you understand!  Then…show me whether what\\\\Nyou’re saying is true or not.  I will! I’ll defeat you no matter\\\\Nwhat and prove that to you!  Dang it… Dang it!  That being said, I don’t feel Chakra at all.  It feels like when I used up\\\\Nmy Chakra in the training.  You possess two kinds of Chakra…  You must extract and utilize, at any time,  the other huge Chakra that\\\\Nhas rested inside you from the start…  That’s it. The Nine-Tailed Fox Chakra…\\\\NI’ll use that…  Stinking fox… \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHelp me out!  This is as far as the talking goes.  Proctor… I’m going to fight with\\\\Nthe intent to kill him!

It’s futile…I pressed the Chakra Points…  No matter what…  Oh, yeah! Be sure to come\\\\Nwatch me kick that Neji’s butt!  A failure beats down\\\\Na genius with effort…  His opponent might be me…  But even if that’s you, Naruto,\\\\Nno hard feelings.  Why do you try to go against\\\\Nyour destiny that much?  Because I was called…  a failure!  No, no way! Chakra is seeping out.  What’s the meaning of this…?  H-He…! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWhat in the world…?!  W-What is he…?!  It can’t be… This Chakra!  T-That’s…impossible!  No way! His Chakra Points\\\\Nhave been pressed!  This Chakra…\\\\Nlt’s the Nine-Tailed Fox\\'s, no doubt…  When did he master\\\\Nthe Nine-Tailed Fox’s Chakra…?!  Here I go!  It’s twisting…  What’s that?!\\\\Nls that even Chakra?!  Awesome power.\\\\NMore so than during the training…  I feel it!  Rotation!  What?!  His speed’s gone up!\\\\NWhat in the world is going on?!  You!  You’re confident in close combat, right?!  You’re going to become the Hokage…?  I don’t… think so.  Only a very small percentage of\\\\NNinja are chosen to be the Hokage!  Look more at reality!  Those who become the Hokage\\\\Nare born with destiny.  It’s not something you become\\\\Nby trying to become it.  It’s determined by destiny.  People must live within\\\\Ntheir different respective currents  that can’t be gone against.  I don’t know what the\\\\NHyuga destiny of hatred is!  But if you’re going to say it’s futile,\\\\Nyou don’t have to do anything!  This is bad! I must use the Rotation!  After I become the Hokage…  I’ll change Hyuga!  What Chakra…  That kid showed some enormous strength…  The Hyuga kid is probably…  Say! Which one’s Naruto?!  I don’t know, either!  Neji’s Rotation is a technique\\\\Nwhere the body rotates,  and dodges and\\\\Nrepels the opponent’s Chakra!  It looks like there was\\\\Nmore damage done to Naruto  since he plunged right into the Rotation.  There’s no Genin that can beat Neji…  But Naruto, you’re incredible…  To think you’d force him this far…  Failure boy…\\\\NSorry, but this is the reality…  Now this is really the en…  My body…  So he left a Shadow clone in the hole\\\\Nand spotted a chance to win, huh…  Believing in victory,\\\\Nthinking about what’s next  and acting even when getting\\\\Nknocked around, huh…  The power of believing in oneself.  That becomes the power\\\\Nto change destiny…  He knows this…\\\\NAnd he’s a natural to boot.  In those conditions,  you used the Shadow Clone Jutsu\\\\Njust like that…  The Ninjutsu that you’re good at, huh?  I was careless…  I’ve…failed the graduation\\\\Nexam three times…  As luck would have it,  the Ninjutsu tests that appeared\\\\Non the graduation exam were always…  infallibly the Ninjutsu I stunk at.  Clone Jutsu was the Ninjutsu…\\\\NI stunk at.  Don’t be whining about boring stuff\\\\Nlike destiny and what not,  and how it can’t be changed!  Because unlike me…\\\\Nyou’re not a failure.

Proctor\\u2026 I\\u2019m going to fight with\\\\Nthe intent to kill him!  If you\\u2019re going to stop me,\\\\Nplease feel free.  Jeez.  Didn\\u2019t I tell you it is pointless?  This time, I really can\\u2019t lose!  I\\u2019ll win no matter what!  It\\u2019s futile\\u2026I pressed the Chakra Points\\u2026  No matter what\\u2026  Oh, yeah! Be sure to come\\\\Nwatch me kick that Neji\\u2019s butt!  A failure beats down\\\\Na genius with effort\\u2026  His opponent might be me\\u2026  But even if that\\u2019s you, Naruto,\\\\Nno hard feelings.  Why do you try to go against\\\\Nyour destiny that much?  Because I was called\\u2026  a failure!  No, no way! Chakra is seeping out.  What\\u2019s the meaning of this\\u2026?  H-He\\u2026! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWhat in the world\\u2026?!  W-What is he\\u2026?!  It can\\u2019t be\\u2026 This Chakra!  T-That\\u2019s\\u2026impossible!  No way! His Chakra Points\\\\Nhave been pressed!  This Chakra\\u2026\\\\Nlt\\u2019s the Nine-Tailed Fox's, no doubt\\u2026  When did he master\\\\Nthe Nine-Tailed Fox\\u2019s Chakra\\u2026?!  Here I go!  It\\u2019s twisting\\u2026  What\\u2019s that?!\\\\Nls that even Chakra?!  Awesome power.\\\\NMore so than during the training\\u2026  I feel it!  Rotation!  What?!  His speed\\u2019s gone up!\\\\NWhat in the world is going on?!  You!  You\\u2019re confident in close combat, right?!  You\\u2019re going to become the Hokage\\u2026?  I don\\u2019t\\u2026 think so.  Only a very small percentage of\\\\NNinja are chosen to be the Hokage!  Look more at reality!  Those who become the Hokage\\\\Nare born with destiny.  It\\u2019s not something you become\\\\Nby trying to become it.  It\\u2019s determined by destiny.  People must live within\\\\Ntheir different respective currents  that can\\u2019t be gone against.  I don\\u2019t know what the\\\\NHyuga destiny of hatred is!  But if you\\u2019re going to say it\\u2019s futile,\\\\Nyou don\\u2019t have to do anything!  This is bad! I must use the Rotation!  After I become the Hokage\\u2026  I\\u2019ll change Hyuga!  What Chakra\\u2026  That kid showed some enormous strength\\u2026  The Hyuga kid is probably\\u2026  Say! Which one\\u2019s Naruto?!  I don\\u2019t know, either!  Neji\\u2019s Rotation is a technique\\\\Nwhere the body rotates,  and dodges and\\\\Nrepels the opponent\\u2019s Chakra!  It looks like there was\\\\Nmore damage done to Naruto  since he plunged right into the Rotation.  There\\u2019s no Genin that can beat Neji\\u2026  But Naruto, you\\u2019re incredible\\u2026  To think you\\u2019d force him this far\\u2026  Failure boy\\u2026\\\\NSorry, but this is the reality\\u2026  Now this is really the en\\u2026  My body\\u2026  So he left a Shadow clone in the hole\\\\Nand spotted a chance to win, huh\\u2026  Believing in victory,\\\\Nthinking about what\\u2019s next  and acting even when getting\\\\Nknocked around, huh\\u2026  The power of believing in oneself.  That becomes the power\\\\Nto change destiny\\u2026  He knows this\\u2026\\\\NAnd he\\u2019s a natural to boot.  In those conditions,  you used the Shadow Clone Jutsu\\\\Njust like that\\u2026  The Ninjutsu that you\\u2019re good at, huh?  I was careless\\u2026  I\\u2019ve\\u2026failed the graduation\\\\Nexam three times\\u2026  As luck would have it,  the Ninjutsu tests that appeared\\\\Non the graduation exam were always\\u2026  infallibly the Ninjutsu I stunk at.  Clone Jutsu was the Ninjutsu\\u2026\\\\NI stunk at.  Don\\u2019t be whining about boring stuff\\\\Nlike destiny and what not,  and how it can\\u2019t be changed!  Because unlike me\\u2026\\\\Nyou\\u2019re not a failure.  Winner of this match is Naruto Uzumaki.  One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks  Two! He kisses and hugs everyone\\\\Nrandomly and says \\u201cI LOVE YOU\\u201d  Three! Masala masters Yoga\\\\Nbut hates curry  Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!

This is a good place.\\\\NYou can see the clouds well.  Yeah\\u2026  Why don\\u2019t you\\u2026  What\\u2026?  watch the clouds with me\\\\Nand lounge around?  Okay!  You know! I-I brought snacks.\\\\NWant some?  Oh, that\\u2019d be great!  Thanks.  Eating potato chips\\\\Nwhile watching clouds\\u2026this is the best.  Yep!  My name is Shikamaru\\u2026\\\\Nfrom the Nara Clan.  You\\u2026 What\\u2019s your name?  It\\u2019s Choji! Choji Akimichi\\\\Nof the Akimichi Clan!  Choji, huh\\u2026\\\\NI think I\\u2019ll get along with you.  Me, too!  We\\u2019ll always do things together\\\\Nfrom now on, too.  Choji\\u2026!  Shikamaru\\u2026 Sorry\\u2026I can\\u2019t go\\u2026  It\\u2019s over\\u2026  But, this guy\\u2026  I have to beat him\\u2026\\\\Neven if it means death.  No matter what you do now,\\\\Nit\\u2019s too late!  Crushing Palm!  Wh-What\\u2019s that\\u2026?  But\\u2026  Boulder Blow!  It\\u2019s no good!  I\\u2019m 100 times stronger than before!  They say that food\\\\Ncan be a reason  for people to hold a horrible grudge\\\\Nagainst somebody.  The blow just now\\u2026\\\\Nwas for eating the last bite of my snack\\u2026  No way!  This guy has so much Chakra that\\\\Nhis body has changed physically!  And this is\\u2026  for making fun of me by calling me\\\\Na sacrificial pawn and fat!  But what I can\\u2019t forgive you for\\\\Nmore than anything else \\u2026  You sure do suffer when\\\\Nyou have a stupid leader. You underlings!  Well\\u2026 I\\u2019ll kill you losers  before you suffer working\\\\Nunder a glum shadow lover like him!  You should blame your stupid leader\\\\Nfor choosing you!  You insulted my best friend!  More than mocking me\\\\Nby calling me fat,  and poaching the last bite\\\\Nof a four-star meal\\u2026  I can\\u2019t forgive you for that!  All of my Chakra\\u2026to my left hand!  Uh, uh-oh\\u2026!  This blow\\u2026is heavier than my life!  W-Wait\\u2026! Don\\u2019t be hasty\\u2026!  I\\u2026I won.  Me\\u2026 I won!  Everyone\\u2026  But Choji\\u2026  you\\u2019re a kindhearted guy,\\\\Nmore than everyone else\\u2026  One day, you\\u2019ll surely make friends\\\\Nwho\\u2019ll see that part of you\\u2026  And then you should cherish\\\\Nthose friends  and be the kind of friends\\\\Nwho believe in each other.  \\u201cHurry up and get over here.\\u201d\\\\Nlt\\u2019s Naruto.  \\u201cEveryone\\u2019s waiting.\\u201d \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tKiba\\u2026  Shikamaru\\u2026  Ino-Shika-Cho!

Nothin\\u2019\\u2026  Once in a long while, once in a while  The remnants of a person\\\\Nbroken by dreams  Look like a mountain  Clinging to the Divine,\\\\Nclinging to Buddha  The remnants of a person crying  Look like a mountain  Rendezvous with a happy dance circle  This is my victory pose, round and around\\\\N (round around)  Shake shake shake\\\\NLet\\u2019s look  With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends  Look like a mountain  Look like a mountain  Look like a mountain  Look like a mountain  Shadow Clone Jutsu!

Naruto\\u2026  A brat who knows nothing\\\\Nshouldn\\u2019t lecture arrogantly!  People are born burdened with\\\\Nan inherent destiny that they cannot defy.  Neji\\u2026live\\u2026  You\\u2019re a man who is blessed\\\\Nwith Hyuga ability  more than anyone in the family\\u2026  I wanted you\\u2026to be born\\\\Ninto the head family\\u2026  You can\\u2019t possibly understand  the destiny of being burdened with\\\\Na mark that cannot be wiped off for life!  Yeah\\u2026  I do understand it.  So\\u2026what of it?  This brat!  Don\\u2019t be acting cool\\u2026  It\\u2019s not just you who\\u2019s special!  Hinata was also\\u2026\\\\Nsuffering the same as you!  Even though she\\u2019s the head family,\\\\Nnot being acknowledged as such\\u2026  trying desperately to change herself\\u2026  She fought you while coughing\\\\Nup blood with that in mind!  You too!  The branch family that\\\\Nprotects the head family\\u2026  Doing all that to Hinata\\\\Njust because it\\u2019s an exam.  In actuality, you were just as frantic  in attempting to go\\\\Nagainst destiny, right?  Vitality has returned to Hinata\\u2019s face!  Just what I\\u2019d expect of\\\\Nthe Anbu Black Ops\\u2026  She'll be okay.  Now she needs bed rest.  Your 64 Chakra Points are now shut\\u2026  How are you, who can\\u2019t use Chakra\\\\Nfor awhile, planning to fight?  At the end of the day,  you and Miss Hinata have\\\\Nthe same destiny!  Shut up!  With your Byakugan, labeling people\\\\Nand talking like you understand!  Then\\u2026show me whether what\\\\Nyou\\u2019re saying is true or not.  I will! I\\u2019ll defeat you no matter\\\\Nwhat and prove that to you!  Dang it\\u2026 Dang it!  That being said, I don\\u2019t feel Chakra at all.  It feels like when I used up\\\\Nmy Chakra in the training.  You possess two kinds of Chakra\\u2026  You must extract and utilize, at any time,  the other huge Chakra that\\\\Nhas rested inside you from the start\\u2026  That\\u2019s it. The Nine-Tailed Fox Chakra\\u2026\\\\NI\\u2019ll use that\\u2026  Stinking fox\\u2026 \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHelp me out!  This is as far as the talking goes.

This time, I really can\\u2019t lose!  I\\u2019ll win no matter what!  It\\u2019s futile\\u2026I pressed the Chakra Points\\u2026  No matter what\\u2026  Oh, yeah! Be sure to come\\\\Nwatch me kick that Neji\\u2019s butt!  A failure beats down\\\\Na genius with effort\\u2026  His opponent might be me\\u2026  But even if that\\u2019s you, Naruto,\\\\Nno hard feelings.  Why do you try to go against\\\\Nyour destiny that much?  Because I was called\\u2026  a failure!  No, no way! Chakra is seeping out.  What\\u2019s the meaning of this\\u2026?  H-He\\u2026! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWhat in the world\\u2026?!  W-What is he\\u2026?!  It can\\u2019t be\\u2026 This Chakra!  T-That\\u2019s\\u2026impossible!  No way! His Chakra Points\\\\Nhave been pressed!  This Chakra\\u2026\\\\Nlt\\u2019s the Nine-Tailed Fox's, no doubt\\u2026  When did he master\\\\Nthe Nine-Tailed Fox\\u2019s Chakra\\u2026?!  Here I go!  It\\u2019s twisting\\u2026  What\\u2019s that?!\\\\Nls that even Chakra?!  Awesome power.\\\\NMore so than during the training\\u2026  I feel it!  Rotation!  What?!  His speed\\u2019s gone up!\\\\NWhat in the world is going on?!  You!  You\\u2019re confident in close combat, right?!  You\\u2019re going to become the Hokage\\u2026?  I don\\u2019t\\u2026 think so.  Only a very small percentage of\\\\NNinja are chosen to be the Hokage!  Look more at reality!  Those who become the Hokage\\\\Nare born with destiny.  It\\u2019s not something you become\\\\Nby trying to become it.  It\\u2019s determined by destiny.  People must live within\\\\Ntheir different respective currents  that can\\u2019t be gone against.  I don\\u2019t know what the\\\\NHyuga destiny of hatred is!  But if you\\u2019re going to say it\\u2019s futile,\\\\Nyou don\\u2019t have to do anything!  This is bad! I must use the Rotation!  After I become the Hokage\\u2026  I\\u2019ll change Hyuga!  What Chakra\\u2026  That kid showed some enormous strength\\u2026  The Hyuga kid is probably\\u2026  Say! Which one\\u2019s Naruto?!  I don\\u2019t know, either!  Neji\\u2019s Rotation is a technique\\\\Nwhere the body rotates,  and dodges and\\\\Nrepels the opponent\\u2019s Chakra!  It looks like there was\\\\Nmore damage done to Naruto  since he plunged right into the Rotation.  There\\u2019s no Genin that can beat Neji\\u2026  But Naruto, you\\u2019re incredible\\u2026  To think you\\u2019d force him this far\\u2026  Failure boy\\u2026\\\\NSorry, but this is the reality\\u2026  Now this is really the en\\u2026  My body\\u2026  So he left a Shadow clone in the hole\\\\Nand spotted a chance to win, huh\\u2026  Believing in victory,\\\\Nthinking about what\\u2019s next  and acting even when getting\\\\Nknocked around, huh\\u2026  The power of believing in oneself.  That becomes the power\\\\Nto change destiny\\u2026  He knows this\\u2026\\\\NAnd he\\u2019s a natural to boot.  In those conditions,  you used the Shadow Clone Jutsu\\\\Njust like that\\u2026  The Ninjutsu that you\\u2019re good at, huh?  I was careless\\u2026  I\\u2019ve\\u2026failed the graduation\\\\Nexam three times\\u2026  As luck would have it,  the Ninjutsu tests that appeared\\\\Non the graduation exam were always\\u2026  infallibly the Ninjutsu I stunk at.  Clone Jutsu was the Ninjutsu\\u2026\\\\NI stunk at.  Don\\u2019t be whining about boring stuff\\\\Nlike destiny and what not,  and how it can\\u2019t be changed!

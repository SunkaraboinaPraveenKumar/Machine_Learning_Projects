The CGPA is the\\nratio of the total credit points secured by a student in all registered courses (of 160) in\\nall semesters, and the total number of credits registered in all the semesters. CGPA is\\nrounded off to two decimal places. CGPA is thus computed from the I year II semester\\nonwards at the end of each semester as per the formula\\nCGPA = { ∑𝐌 𝐂 𝐆 } / { ∑𝐌 𝐂 } … for all S semesters registered\\n𝐣(cid:2880)𝟏 𝐣 𝐣 𝐣(cid:2880)𝟏 𝐣\\n(i.e., up to and inclusive of S semesters, S \\uf0b3 2),\\n13\\n'),\n",

Each grade corresponds to a specific percentage range and has a grade point assigned. For example, 'O' is 10 points, 'A+' is 9, and so on until 'F' which is 0.\n",

The grades are assigned based on the total percentage from both. So, if a student scores, say, 85%, they get an 'A+' grade with 9 points.\n",
            "\n",
            "I also notice that failing is clearly defined. If a student gets an 'F' grade, they have to reappear for the exam as a supplementary student. Their internal marks remain the same, but they have to take the semester end exam again. The same applies if they were absent, getting an 'Ab' grade, which also counts as a fail.\n",

            "There's a part about the Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA), which is calculated by summing up the credit points (CP) from all subjects and dividing by the total credits. This gives an average for the semester, rounded to two decimal places. So, each subject's grade point is multiplied by its credits to get CP, and all CPs are added up.\n",
            "\n",
            "Additionally, a student passes a subject only if their grade point is 5 or above, which corresponds to a 'C' grade or higher. This means even if they have some lower grades, as long as they meet this threshold, they pass.\n",
            "\n",
            "I should also consider how the grades don't specify the exact percentage but only the range. This means that a 'B' grade, for instance, just tells you the student scored between 50-60%, not the exact number.\n",
            "\n",

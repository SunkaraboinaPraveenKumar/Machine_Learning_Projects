SGPA is rounded off to two decimal \\nplaces. SGPA is thus computed as \\nSGPA = { ∑ 𝐂𝐢𝐍𝐢ୀ𝟏  𝐆𝐢 } / { ∑ 𝐂𝐢𝐍𝐢ୀ𝟏  } …. For each semester, \\nwhere ‘i’ is the subject indicator index (considering all subjects in a semester), ‘N’ is \\nthe no. of subjects ‘registered’ for the semester (as specifically required and listed \\nunder the course structure of the parent department), C୧ is the no. of credits allotted to \\nthe ith subject, and G୧ represents the grade points (GP) corresponding to the letter grade \\nawarded for that ith subject. \\n9.9   The Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) is a measure of the overall cumulative \\nperformance of a student in all semesters considered for registration. The CGPA is the \\nratio of the total credit points secured by a student in all registered courses (of 160) in \\nall semesters, and the total number of credits registered in all the semesters. CGPA is \\nrounded off to two decimal places. CGPA is thus computed from the I year II semester \\nonwards at the end of each semester as per the formula \\nCGPA = { ∑ 𝐂𝐣𝐌𝐣ୀ𝟏  𝐆𝐣 } / { ∑ 𝐂𝐣𝐌𝐣ୀ𝟏  } … for all S semesters registered \\n(i.e., up to and inclusive of S semesters, S \\uf0b3 2), ', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",
